You can use the editor of your choice but all the coaches are using VSCode.

Install it with `brew` or [download it manually on the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

```console
$ brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

Inside VSCode, press `Ctrl`+`P`, and enter:

```
ext install vscode-language-babel
```

Congratulations! You can install your first extention, it should be the top result.
