# Setup instructions for React with macOS

The following instructions will help you to get ready for [ReactJS academy bootcamp](https://reactjs.academy/):

- Install a package manager
- Install the text editor used by ReactJS developers
- Install `NodeJS` and `create-react-app`
- Pimp your Terminal
- Up-to-date browser with React Developer Tools: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code

You can use the editor of your choice but all the coaches are using VSCode.

Install it with `brew` or [download it manually on the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

```console
$ brew cask install visual-studio-code
```

Inside VSCode, press `âŒ˜`+`P`, and enter:

```
ext install vscode-language-babel
```

Congratulations! You can install your first extention, it should be the top result.

## Install a Node Version Manager

```console
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

## Pimp your terminal

```console
npm install -g spaceship-prompt
```

Done. This command should link `spaceship.zsh` as `prompt_spaceship_setup` to your `$fpath` and set `prompt spaceship` in `.zshrc`. Just reload your terminal.
